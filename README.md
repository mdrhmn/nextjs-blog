# Sample Next.js Project

This is a sample Next.js project that I created to tinker around with Next.js and Chakra UI.

## Creating a Next.js App

To create a new blank Next.js app:

```jsx
npx create-next-app
```

To create a new Next.js app based on a starter template:

```jsx
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn-starter/tree/master/learn-starter"
```

To run the newly created Next.js app:

```jsx
npm run dev
```

## Installing Chakra UI

To install Chakra UI:

```jsx
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```
